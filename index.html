       &lt Measure  &nbsp the size of magnetic fiel&thinsp d under a specific distance: &gt <br>
       1. Connect the gauss&nbsp meter to the probe, and the power, and perform the setting procedure accordingly as to locate its N/S poles (see instructions). <br>
       2. Arrange the device following Fig. 3 and pay &nbsp attention to the direction the probe is set. Magnetic rotating Chip shaftSlightly rotate the shaft to <br> 
          adjust the distance d&nbsp between&nbsp N pole and the semiconductor. Take a 0.5 thick acrylic board with d = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 cm. Measure each magnetic <br>
         field distance and put your findings  &nbsp in the chart. <br>
       (Disengage the test board first&nbsp after finishing and use the gauss meter to observe longitudinal changes in the field surroundings for Question 3).<br>
        <br>
        <Determine a P-type or N-type material, &nbsp and its concentration:>
       1. Set the multimeter to DC voltage and arrange all the instruments according to Fig. 4. Keep
       the base plate 30 cm. away from the magnet rack to find the voltage reading above zero, even without a magnetic field present. This is due to the 
        wire bound to the semiconductor causing its position to be not exactly symmetrical (see Fig. 5). Connect variable resistors at point 2, 3, and 4 
        (the 5th point), tune until the voltage maintains under &nbsp 1 mV. Observe for over 1 minute to ensure the stability of the zero-offset voltage.
        2. Adjust the shaftâ€™s N pole to be level with the acrylic cover of the semiconductor wafer with distance d set to 0.5 cm. Read the ammeter and voltmeter 
        and deduct its zero-offset voltage, to get the actual Hall voltage. Record your readings in the chart.
        3. Identify the current direction I between point 2 and 3 in the chart, the polarity of the Hall voltage between point 3 and 4, and the direction of magnetic
        field B. With these 3 data, determine whether the chip material  &nbsp is P-type or N-type.
        
        <Identify the material of wafer>
        ____-type semiconductor (mark color: red) ____-type semiconductor (mark color: black)
        4. Add a 0.5 cm thick acrylic plate between the magnet and the cover with distances of 1, 1.5, 5, 5.2 cm. Repeat step (2) and make a chart (with magnetic field 
        B as the vertical axis, and voltage V as the horizontal) to analyze the slop of carrier concentration n by Eq. (6).
        5. Switch to measure a different colored wafer and repeat steps (1) to (4) to obtain value n.
