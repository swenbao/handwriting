   3. Measure the angle of minimum deviation<br> &nbsp 
(1) Open the aperture to the maximum  &nbsp before turning  &nbsp on the mercury lamp. Adjust  &nbsp the position of the mercury lamp to make the light is focused <br>
    on the slit of the  &nbsp collimator through the lens.<br>
(2) Place the  &nbsp prism on the platform (as  &nbsp shown in Fig. 8), let about 4/5 incident light go  &nbsp through the prism  &nbsp for refraction, and the rest of 1/5 <br>
    incident &nbsp  light  &nbsp go through the  &nbsp bottom of the prism for reflection.<br>
(3) Loos the (1c) fixed knob for telescope &nbsp , move the telescope and observe the spectrum of  &nbsp the mercury  &nbsp lamp. Compare it to the marked 8 chromatic <br>
   light in Fig. 10. Adjust &nbsp  the position of the mercury lamp and check if the 6  &nbsp red lines are clear (red light   &nbsp &nbsp is dimmer, the other color lines <br>
    will also be clear if the red lines  &nbsp are clear).<br> &nbsp 
(4) Loose  &nbsp the (3b) &nbsp  platform fixed knob and rotate the platform (change the incident angle), and let the spectrum move toward &nbsp  the incident lite. <br>
    Observe the red line marked as 1 in Fig. 10, when the incident angle &nbsp  is the angle of  &nbsp minimum deviation, the reflected &nbsp  white light from the <br>
    bottom of the prism will be parallel to the red  &nbsp line, then you can observe the two lights  &nbsp are overlapped.<br>
(5) Use the knob  &nbsp (1c) to fix telescope and knob (3b) to fix the platform, then adjust  &nbsp (1d) to lineup the &nbsp  red line. Record the incident direction from <br>
    the (4) vernier &nbsp  as d1. then loose  &nbsp the fixed  &nbsp knob (1c), adjust the telescope to the collimator and record the  &nbsp incident direction from the (4) <br>
     vernier as d2. The difference between d1 and d2 is the angle of minimum deviation D.<br>
(6) Repeat steps (4) and (5) &nbsp , observe and record d1  &nbsp for light lines marked as 2 to 8 in Fig. 10 (rotate the &nbsp  platform to make the reflected white light <br>
    overlap to the chromatic &nbsp  &nbsp  light). The incident direction of d2 doesn’t need &nbsp  to be re-recorded. Record the d1  &nbsp and d2 for 8 chromatic lights for 5 times.<br>
4. Calculate &nbsp  index of refraction n of the  &nbsp prism for 8 chromatic lights<br>
(1) Calculate the index of refraction &nbsp  n from the angle of minimum deviation  &nbsp for 5 times individually, then calculate the average and standard deviation of n.<br>
(2) Obtain &nbsp  the different n values &nbsp  which correspond to different chromatic &nbsp  light (wavelength). This experiment  &nbsp further aims to find the relation between the index<br>
    of refraction and wavelength (within the range of visible light). Mark (λ, n) in the n-l plot (n is vertical axis and l is horizontal axis). Then, plot a <br>
    smooth  &nbsp curve  &nbsp connecting each dot.  &nbsp If some &nbsp  dot is not located on  &nbsp the curve, it is a wrong one. It could happen when serious errors occur. The curve is called <br>
    dispersion curve within the  &nbsp range of visiblelight. Different curves happen along with  &nbsp different substances used.<br>
