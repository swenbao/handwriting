      In n-type  &nbsp semiconductors, doping with pentavalent phosphorus &nbsp  atoms forms  &nbsp covalent bonds with  &nbsp four silicon atoms, <br>
        leaving  &nbsp one extra electron unpaired. This &nbsp unpaired electron  &nbsp becomes a free electron  &nbsp as there is no paired hole <br>
        (missing electron) to pair up with. These free electrons &nbsp  can  &nbsp move within  &nbsp the semiconductor due to their negative <br>
        charge and attraction  &nbsp to positive  &nbsp charges.
        
        
        
        
        
        1. Adjust the laser beam and 1 m optical bench (see Fig. 10):
        (a) Have the laser placed 40 cm away in front of the 1 m optical bench.
        (b) Place the holder to the very right of the bench. Move position (1) to 90 cm and connect the fiber with the optical amplifier.
        (c) Adjust both sides of the holder to 0 mm. Place the fiber into the mounting hole. Afterthe front end of the fiber is aligned with position 
        (1), tighten the mounting screws (see Fig. 8).
    
        2. Adjust the light diffusion tube (as shown in Fig. 9):
         Rotate both the height screw and windage screw to make sure the laser beam passes through the tube to the front end of the fiber (the light 
        diffusion tube has already been fixated to the front end of the laser).
      
        3. Adjust the optical amplifier (see Fig. 7):
         (a) Connect the 9V DC power to the output terminal on the amplifier and switch it on.
         (b) Turn on the power of the amplifier and adjust the amplifier’s input knob to 300 Lux.Also, rotate right the “Sensitivity Adjust” to CAL.
         (c) Slightly adjust both screws of the diffusion tube to move the laser spot, which enables the reading values on the ammeter to reach its maximum.
         (d) Place the single slit at position (1) on the fiber holder with 0.2 mm slit approximately aligned with the optical fiber. Move the slit film to 
        its right and left to enable the reading values on the ammeter to reach its maximum so the slit is aligned with the optical fiber.
      
        4. Adjust the position of double slit:
         (a) Place the double slit on the magnetic optical bench in front of the laser and move the double slit to its right and left to enable the beam 
        shine on the center of the double slit roughly between a = 0.04 mm and d = 0.125 mm (with the flashlight irradiating the double slit from the opposite 
        direction, which makes it easier to make adjustment).
         (b) Carefully adjust the level of the double slit lest the interference pattern tilts too far away, causing it to deviate from the scan lines of the 
        optical fiber head, which in turn will greatly influence the intensity of the measurement signals.
       
        5. Record data:
         (a) Adjust the input knob of the optical amplifier to “30 Lux” to obscure the laser beam.  Also, adjust the “Zero Adjust” knob to zero (lower than ±1 mv 
        is acceptable)
         (b) Left-adjust the optical fiber to 22.0 mm and record the reading values on the ammeter every 0.2 mm starting from 20.0 mm to 20.0 mm on the right (200 
        test points in total). p.s. After the laser beam has been obscured, read the background value first and then brightness value. The difference between the 
        two values is the actual measured value.
    
        A. Record parameters: L, a, d, and l .
    
        B. Record data: the corresponding intensity (voltage) from 14 mm on the lift to the 15.8 mm on the right.
         (c) Turn off the powers of the laser, ammeter, and the optical amplifier.
         (d) Plot curve on a piece of graph paper based on the data obtained from the 200 data points as shown in Fig. 6 (including the space around both sides of 
        the central bright band).
         (e) Mark on the plot the double slit interference’s max bright line on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th levels, as well as the min dark line on the first level.
        Record both Xl and Xr which are the positions measured from the left and right of the central bright line, respectively.
         (f) Calculatethevaluesofthesingleslit’swidthaandthedoubleslit’sdistancedreferring to Eqs. (4) and (2), and their errors.
        
        C. Record data: the positions of Xl, Xr, q , a, and their percentage error of the first dark line in single slit diffraction. q = (Xl –Xr)/2L.
         
        D. Recorddata:thepositionsofXl,Xr, q,a,andtheirpercentageerrorofthe1st,2nd, 4th, and 5th bright line in double slit interference. q = (Xl –Xr)/2L.
