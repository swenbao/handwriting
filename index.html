    <p class="a">       
        1. Adjust the laser beam and 1 m optical bench (see Fig. 10):<br>
        (a) Have &nbsp the laser placed 40 cm away in &nbsp  front of the 1 m optical bench.<br>
        (b) Place the holder to the very right &nbsp  of the &nbsp  bench. &nbsp  Move position  &nbsp (1) &nbsp  to 90  &nbsp cm and connect the fiber with the optical amplifier.<br>
        (c) Adjust both  &nbsp sides of &nbsp  the holder to 0 mm.  &nbsp Place the &nbsp  fiber into the mounting hole. After &nbsp  the front end of the fiber is aligned with position <br>
        (1), tighten &nbsp  the  &nbsp  &nbsp mounting screws (see Fig. 8).<br>
        <br>
        2. Adjust the light  &nbsp  &nbsp diffusion  &nbsp tube (as shown in Fig. 9):<br>
         Rotate both the  &nbsp height screw  &nbsp and windage  &nbsp screw to make sure the laser beam passes through the tube to the front end of the fiber (the light <br>
        diffusion tube has already been fixated to &nbsp  the front end of &nbsp  the laser).<br>
      
        <br>
        3. Adjust the optical amplifier (see Fig. 7):<br>
         (a) Connect the 9V DC power to the output terminal &nbsp  on the amplifier and switch it on.<br>
         (b) Turn on  &nbsp the power of the amplifier and adjust the  &nbsp amplifier‚Äôs input knob to 300 Lux.Also, rotate right the ‚ÄúSensitivity Adjust‚Äù to CAL.<br>
         (c) Slightly adjust both screws of the &nbsp  diffusion tube to move &nbsp  the laser spot, which enables the reading values on the ammeter to reach its maximum.<br>
         (d) Place  &nbsp the single &nbsp  slit at position (1) on  &nbsp the fiber &nbsp  holder with  &nbsp 0.2 mm slit approximately aligned with the optical fiber. Move the slit film to <br>
        its right and left  &nbsp to enable the reading values on &nbsp  the ammeter  &nbsp to reach its &nbsp  maximum so the slit is aligned with the optical fiber.<br>
      
        <br>
        4. Adjust the position of double slit:<br>
         (a) Place  &nbsp  &nbsp the double slit on the magnetic optical bench in front of the  &nbsp laser and move the double slit to its right and left to enable the beam <br>
        shine on the center  &nbsp of the double  &nbsp slit roughly between a = 0.04  &nbsp mm and d = 0.125 mm (with the flashlight irradiating the double slit from the opposite <br>
        direction, which  &nbsp makes it easier  &nbsp to make adjustment).<br>
         (b) Carefully adjust the level of  &nbsp the double slit lest  &nbsp the interference pattern tilts too  &nbsp far away, causing it to deviate from the scan lines of the <br>
        optical  &nbsp fiber head,  &nbsp which in turn will greatly  &nbsp influence the  &nbsp intensity of the measurement signals.<br>
       
        <br>
        5. Record data:<br>
         (a) Adjust  &nbsp the input knob of the optical amplifier to ‚Äú30 Lux‚Äù to obscure  &nbsp the laser beam.  &nbsp  Also, adjust the ‚ÄúZero Adjust‚Äù knob to zero (lower than ¬±1 mv <br>
        is acceptable)<br>
         (b) Left-adjust the optical  &nbsp fiber to 22.0 mm and record the reading values on the ammeter every  &nbsp 0.2 mm starting from 20.0 mm to 20.0 mm on the right (200 <br>
        test points in total). p.s. After the laser beam has been obscured, read the  &nbsp background value first and then brightness value. The difference between the <br>
        two values is the actual measured value.<br>
        A. Record parameters: L, a, d, and l .<br>
        B. Record data: the corresponding intensity (voltage) from 14 mm on the lift to  &nbsp the 15.8 mm on the right.<br>
         (c) Turn off the powers of the  &nbsp laser, ammeter, and the optical amplifier.<br>
         (d) Plot curve on a  &nbsp piece of graph paper based on the data obtained from the 200 data points as shown in Fig. 6 (including the space around both sides of <br>
        the central bright band).<br>
         (e) Mark on  &nbsp the plot the double slit interference‚Äôs max bright  &nbsp line on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th levels, as well as the min dark line on the first level.<br>
        Record both Xl and Xr which are the positions measured  &nbsp from the &nbsp  left and right of the central bright line, respectively.<br>
         (f) Calculate the value so fthesing les lit‚Äôswidth aand the doubles lit &nbsp ‚Äôsdistanced  &nbsp referring to Eqs. (4) and (2), and their errors.<br>
        C. Record data:  &nbsp the positions of Xl, Xr, q , a, and their percentage error of the first &nbsp  dark line in single slit diffraction. q = (Xl ‚ÄìXr)/2L.<br>
        D. Recorddata:the position so  &nbsp fXl,Xr, q,a,andtheirpercentageerrorofthe1st,2nd, 4th, and 5th bright &nbsp  line in double slit interference. q = (Xl ‚ÄìXr)/2L<br>
        (g) Calculate the intensity  &nbsp of the double slit‚Äôs  &nbsp interference‚Äôs 1st and 2nd max and the intensity ratio &nbsp  of the central bright line and verify Eq. (5).<br>
         E. Record data: Intensity: central bright line, 1st and 2nd bright  &nbsp lines, the  &nbsp intensity  &nbsp ratios to the central &nbsp  bright line and errors.<br>
       
        <br>
        2. Based  &nbsp on the interference  &nbsp and diffraction &nbsp  pattern, experimental error, and  &nbsp experience,please adjust the experimental setup and repeat the measurement 2 to 4 <br>
        times to get the best results<br>
        F. Question: &nbsp  please indicate which maximum interference are disappeared? Why?<br>
        G. Question: please derive the relationship of ùêº" ‚â° 1/T ‚à´ùê∏(ùë°)2ùëëùë° = 1/2* ùê∏2<br>
        ùëá = 2*pi/omega<br>
        
        <br>
        6. Extension experiment:<br>
        (a) Try to use different single and double &nbsp  slits (made by yourself or provided by lab) and repeat the experiment to verify Eqs. (1) ~ (5).<br>
        (b) Take you  &nbsp and your teammate‚Äôs hairs and fix them on the hard paper frame individually, &nbsp  then put them to the positions of slit and observe the diffraction pattern.<br>
        Compare the  &nbsp  &nbsp difference to the  &nbsp single slit experiment, then  &nbsp compare the thicknesses of two/three hairs.<br>
        (c) Try to use your  &nbsp cellphone &nbsp  (camera) to replace &nbsp  the fiber as the sensor. Repeat the experiment.<br>
        (d) Take the pictures of the knife-edge &nbsp  diffraction, single  &nbsp hole diffraction, &nbsp  and multiple hole &nbsp  diffraction.<br>
