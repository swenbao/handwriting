   3. Measure the angle of minimum deviation<br>
(1) Open the aperture to the maximum before turning on the mercury lamp. Adjust the position of the mercury lamp to make the light is focused <br>
    on the slit of the collimator through the lens.<br>
(2) Place the prism on the platform (as shown in Fig. 8), let about 4/5 incident light go through the prism for refraction, and the rest of 1/5 <br>
    incident light go through the bottom of the prism for reflection.<br>
(3) Loos the (1c) fixed knob for telescope, move the telescope and observe the spectrum of the mercury lamp. Compare it to the marked 8 chromatic <br>
   light in Fig. 10. Adjust the position of the mercury lamp and check if the 6 red lines are clear (red light is dimmer, the other color lines <br>
    will also be clear if the red lines are clear).<br>
(4) Loose the (3b) platform fixed knob and rotate the platform (change the incident angle), and let the spectrum move toward the incident lite. <br>
    Observe the red line marked as 1 in Fig. 10, when the incident angle is the angle of minimum deviation, the reflected white light from the <br>
    bottom of the prism will be parallel to the red line, then you can observe the two lights are overlapped.<br>
(5) Use the knob (1c) to fix telescope and knob (3b) to fix the platform, then adjust (1d) to lineup the red line. Record the incident direction from <br>
    the (4) vernier as d1. then loose the fixed knob (1c), adjust the telescope to the collimator and record the incident direction from the (4) <br>
     vernier as d2. The difference between d1 and d2 is the angle of minimum deviation D.<br>
(6) Repeat steps (4) and (5), observe and record d1 for light lines marked as 2 to 8 in Fig. 10 (rotate the platform to make the reflected white light <br>
    overlap to the chromatic light). The incident direction of d2 doesn’t need to be re-recorded. Record the d1 and d2 for 8 chromatic lights for 5 times.<br>
4. Calculate index of refraction n of the prism for 8 chromatic lights<br>
(1) Calculate the index of refraction n from the angle of minimum deviation for 5 times individually, then calculate the average and standard deviation of n.<br>
(2) Obtain the different n values which correspond to different chromatic light (wavelength). This experiment further aims to find the relation between the index<br>
    of refraction and wavelength (within the range of visible light). Mark (λ, n) in the n-l plot (n is vertical axis and l is horizontal axis). Then, plot a <br>
    smooth curve connecting each dot. If some dot is not located on the curve, it is a wrong one. It could happen when serious errors occur. The curve is called <br>
    dispersion curve within the range of visiblelight. Different curves happen along with different substances used.<br>
