    <p class="a"> 
      In n-type  &nbsp semiconductors, doping with pentavalent phosphorus &nbsp  atoms forms  &nbsp covalent bonds with  &nbsp four silicon atoms, <br>
        leaving  &nbsp one extra electron unpaired. This &nbsp unpaired electron  &nbsp becomes a free electron  &nbsp as there is no paired hole <br>
        (missing electron) to pair up with. These free electrons &nbsp  can  &nbsp move within  &nbsp the semiconductor due to their negative <br>
        charge and attraction  &nbsp to positive  &nbsp charges.
        
        
        
        
        
        1. Adjust the laser beam and 1 m optical bench (see Fig. 10):<br>
        (a) Have the laser placed 40 cm away in front of the 1 m optical bench.<br>
        (b) Place the holder to the very right of the bench. Move position (1) to 90 cm and connect the fiber with the optical amplifier.<br>
        (c) Adjust both sides of the holder to 0 mm. Place the fiber into the mounting hole. Afterthe front end of the fiber is aligned with position <br>
        (1), tighten the mounting screws (see Fig. 8).<br>
    <br>
        <br>
        2. Adjust the light diffusion tube (as shown in Fig. 9):<br>
         Rotate both the height screw and windage screw to make sure the laser beam passes through the tube to the front end of the fiber (the light <br>
        diffusion tube has already been fixated to the front end of the laser).<br>
      <br>
        <br>
        3. Adjust the optical amplifier (see Fig. 7):<br>
         (a) Connect the 9V DC power to the output terminal on the amplifier and switch it on.<br>
         (b) Turn on the power of the amplifier and adjust the amplifier‚Äôs input knob to 300 Lux.Also, rotate right the ‚ÄúSensitivity Adjust‚Äù to CAL.<br>
         (c) Slightly adjust both screws of the diffusion tube to move the laser spot, which enables the reading values on the ammeter to reach its maximum.<br>
         (d) Place the single slit at position (1) on the fiber holder with 0.2 mm slit approximately aligned with the optical fiber. Move the slit film to <br>
        its right and left to enable the reading values on the ammeter to reach its maximum so the slit is aligned with the optical fiber.<br>
      <br>
        <br>
        4. Adjust the position of double slit:<br>
         (a) Place the double slit on the magnetic optical bench in front of the laser and move the double slit to its right and left to enable the beam <br>
        shine on the center of the double slit roughly between a = 0.04 mm and d = 0.125 mm (with the flashlight irradiating the double slit from the opposite <br>
        direction, which makes it easier to make adjustment).<br>
         (b) Carefully adjust the level of the double slit lest the interference pattern tilts too far away, causing it to deviate from the scan lines of the <br>
        optical fiber head, which in turn will greatly influence the intensity of the measurement signals.<br>
       <br>
        <br>
        5. Record data:<br>
         (a) Adjust the input knob of the optical amplifier to ‚Äú30 Lux‚Äù to obscure the laser beam.  Also, adjust the ‚ÄúZero Adjust‚Äù knob to zero (lower than ¬±1 mv <br>
        is acceptable)<br>
         (b) Left-adjust the optical fiber to 22.0 mm and record the reading values on the ammeter every 0.2 mm starting from 20.0 mm to 20.0 mm on the right (200 <br>
        test points in total). p.s. After the laser beam has been obscured, read the background value first and then brightness value. The difference between the <br>
        two values is the actual measured value.<br>
        A. Record parameters: L, a, d, and l .<br>
        B. Record data: the corresponding intensity (voltage) from 14 mm on the lift to the 15.8 mm on the right.<br>
         (c) Turn off the powers of the laser, ammeter, and the optical amplifier.<br>
         (d) Plot curve on a piece of graph paper based on the data obtained from the 200 data points as shown in Fig. 6 (including the space around both sides of <br>
        the central bright band).<br>
         (e) Mark on the plot the double slit interference‚Äôs max bright line on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th levels, as well as the min dark line on the first level.<br>
        Record both Xl and Xr which are the positions measured from the left and right of the central bright line, respectively.<br>
         (f) Calculatethevaluesofthesingleslit‚Äôswidthaandthedoubleslit‚Äôsdistancedreferring to Eqs. (4) and (2), and their errors.<br>
        C. Record data: the positions of Xl, Xr, q , a, and their percentage error of the first dark line in single slit diffraction. q = (Xl ‚ÄìXr)/2L.<br>
        D. Recorddata:thepositionsofXl,Xr, q,a,andtheirpercentageerrorofthe1st,2nd, 4th, and 5th bright line in double slit interference. q = (Xl ‚ÄìXr)/2L<br>
        (g) Calculate the intensity of the double slit‚Äôs interference‚Äôs 1st and 2nd max and the intensity ratio of the central bright line and verify Eq. (5).<br>
         E. Record data: Intensity: central bright line, 1st and 2nd bright lines, the intensity ratios to the central bright line and errors.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Based on the interference and diffraction pattern, experimental error, and experience,please adjust the experimental setup and repeat the measurement 2 to 4 <br>
        times to get the best results<br>
        F. Question: please indicate which maximum interference are disappeared? Why?<br>
        G. Question: please derive the relationship of ùêº" ‚â° 1/T ‚à´ùê∏(ùë°)2ùëëùë° = 1/2* ùê∏2<br>
        ùëá = 2*pi/omega
        <br>
        <br>
        6. Extension experiment:<br>
        (a) Try to use different single and double slits (made by yourself or provided by lab) and repeat the experiment to verify Eqs. (1) ~ (5).<br>
        (b) Take you and your teammate‚Äôs hairs and fix them on the hard paper frame individually, then put them to the positions of slit and observe the diffraction pattern.<br>
        Compare the difference to the single slit experiment, then compare the thicknesses of two/three hairs.<br>
        (c) Try to use your cellphone (camera) to replace the fiber as the sensor. Repeat the experiment.<br>
        (d) Take the pictures of the knife-edge diffraction, single hole diffraction, and multiple hole diffraction.<br>
