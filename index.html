       &lt Measure  &nbsp the size of magnetic fiel &thinsp d under a specific distance: &gt <br>
       1. Connect the gauss&nbsp meter to the probe, and the power, and perform the setting  &nbsp procedure accordingly as to locate its N/S poles (see instructions). <br>
       2. Arrange the  &nbsp device following Fig. 3 and pay &nbsp attention to the direction the  &nbsp probe is set. Magnetic rotating Chip shaftSlightly rotate the shaft to <br> 
          adjust the distance d &nbsp between &nbsp N pole and  &nbsp the semiconductor. Take a 0.5 thick acrylic board with d = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 cm. Measure each magnetic <br>
         field  &nbsp distance and put your findings  &nbsp in the chart. <br>
       (Disengage the test board first&nbsp after finishing and use the gauss meter to &nbsp observe  &nbsp longitudinal changes in the field surroundings for Question 3).
        <br>
        &lt Determine a P-type or N-type material, &nbsp and its concentration: &gt
       1. Set the multimeter to DC voltage and arrange all &nbsp  the instruments according to Fig. 4. Keepthe base plate 30 cm. away from the magnet rack to find the voltage <br>
        reading above zero, even without a magnetic field present. &nbsp  This is due to the  wire bound to the  &nbsp semiconductor causing its position to be not exactly symmetrical <br>
        (see Fig. 5). Connect variable resistors at point 2, 3, and 4 (the 5th point), tune until the voltage maintains under &nbsp 1 mV. Observe for over 1 minute to ensure <br> 
        the stability of the zero-offset voltage.<br>
        2. Adjust the shaftâ€™s N pole to be level with the acrylic cover  &nbsp of the semiconductor wafer with  &nbsp distance d set to 0.5 cm. Read the ammeter and voltmeter <br>
        and deduct its zero-offset  &nbsp voltage,  &nbsp to get the actual  &nbsp Hall voltage. Record your readings in the chart.<br>
        3. Identify the current direction  &nbsp I between point 2 and 3 in the   &nbsp chart, the polarity of the Hall voltage between point 3 and 4, and the direction of magnetic<br>
        field B. With these 3 data, determine whether the chip material  &nbsp is P-type or N-type.<br>
        
        &lt Identify the material of wafer &gt <br>
        ____-type semiconductor (mark color: red) <br>
        ____-type semiconductor (mark color: black)<br>
        4. Add a 0.5 cm thick acrylic  &nbsp  plate between the magnet and the cover with distances of 1, 1.5, 5, 5.2 cm.  &nbsp Repeat step (2) and make a chart (with magnetic field <br>
        B as the vertical axis, and voltage V as the  &nbsp horizontal) to analyze the slop of  &nbsp carrier concentration n by Eq. (6).<br>
        5. Switch to measure a different colored wafer and repeat steps (1) to (4) to obtain value n.<br>
