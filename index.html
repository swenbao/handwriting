1.Connect the apparatus following Fig. 4.<br>
2. Turn the knobs of current and voltage counterclockwise to the end and then turn the current knob clockwise to <br>
        set it as the CV mode.<br>
3. Adjust the multimeters: the minimum voltage to be 0.01 V and the minimum voltage to be 3 V; and the minimum <br>
   current to be 0.01 mA and the maximum current to be 20 mA.<br>
4. Turn the voltage knob clockwise and record the voltage and current. Suggestions: use 0.1 V setep before the <br>
   LED is lighted and 0.05 step after the LED is lighted (the light is very weak). Stop the voltage after <br>
   the current exceed 20 mA. Note: the current needs to be lower than 20 mA and the voltage needs to be lower than 3 V.<br>
5. Take the part at high current where is more linear and fit by a linear function. Use the intersection of 0 current <br>
   and this function to be the “bulit-in voltage” of the LED.<br>
6. Put the cover of LED on the LED and use cellphone to take a picture. Try to make the color in the center to the <br>
   uniform, as shown in Fig. 5.        <br>
7. Open the webpage https://academo.org/demos/wavelength-to-colour-relationship/ (Wavelength to Colour Relationship). <br>
   Drag the bar on the webpage and find the closed color to the center of the LED. Record the wavelength from the webpage.<br>
8. Obtain the Planck constant using Eq. 1.<br>
9. Turn down the voltage to 0. Change the LED and repeat steps 4 to 9.<br>
10. Discuss the source of the largest uncertainty in the experiment.<br>
