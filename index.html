1.Apparatus set up:<br>
 (1) Place the mercury lamp, photoelectric tube and optical set in the positions as shown in Fig. 2 (no wheel set for now).<br>
(2) Connect all the cables according to Fig.  &nbsp 3, and set &nbsp  the 6-1/2 digit multimeter to “Direct current”.<br>
(3) Turn on each equipment’s power for 15 &nbsp  minutes.<br>
(4) Adjust the photoelectric tube set to align  &nbsp the entry of light and the opening of the lens<br>
on the mercry lamp.<br>
(5) Adjust the direction of the mercury lamp to be parallel to the direction of the optical<br>
set.<br>
2. Illuminance:<br>
Note: the distance between the photoelectric tube set and mercury lamp should be larger than 25 cm when the filter is not uused to avoid <br>
the damage &nbsp  oon the photoelectric &nbsp  tube.<br>
(1) Adjust the photoelectric tube &nbsp  set with &nbsp  zero biased &nbsp  voltage and without fliter, place the photoelectric tube set &nbsp  25 cm away from the <br>
mercury lamp (L = 25 cm, where is the focus point the the lens  &nbsp of the mercury lamp &nbsp . You can use a  &nbsp paper to find it.) &nbsp  Recored it as the <br>
photoelectric  &nbsp current I.<br>
(2) Move the photoelectric tube set 2  &nbsp cm more away from the lamp  &nbsp and repeat &nbsp  the previous set  &nbsp 14 times and record it.<br>
(3) Use I as x-axis and 1 as y-axis, plot it to prove the 1/r2 relation between illuminance L2<br>
and distance.<br>
3. Measure the voltage of the cut-off current of the 5 main spectra of the  &nbsp mercury lamp (make the aperture to be largest)<br>
(1) Place the wheel set oof filers to the plateform of  &nbsp photoelectric  &nbsp tube as shown in Fig. 2<br>
and put the plateform as close as possible to the mercury lamp.  &nbsp Turn the UV filter (Mark 1) to  &nbsp the specified position ( &nbsp in front of the lens),<br>
set the reversed  &nbsp voltage to be zero, and &nbsp  adjust the wheel set &nbsp  and the photoelectric  &nbsp tube set to make the photoelectric &nbsp   current to be maximum <br>
and record it as I0.<br> &nbsp 
(2) Slowly increase the &nbsp  reverse biased voltage to decrease the photoelectric current, until<br>
the current is  &nbsp between -0.0001 and 0.0001. This voltage is the cut-off current for the<br>
UV light and record &nbsp  it &nbsp  as V.<br>
(3) Repest  &nbsp these  &nbsp two steps for dark purple,  &nbsp purple, green, and yellow.<br>
2. Calculate the &nbsp  Planck constant:<br>
(1) Make  &nbsp the V vs.  &nbsp  &nbsp v plot using the frequency of light v as the x-axis and the voltage of<br>
cut-off current V as y-axis.<br>
(2) Measure the slope m of thie  &nbsp linear line (unit: V‧s), &nbsp  then use Eq.(2) to obtain the Planck<br>
constant h = me  &nbsp (where e is the electric charg).<br>
(3)  &nbsp Calculate the error of the experiment and the Planck constant h is 6.63 × 10-34 J‧s.<br>
*The frequencies &nbsp  of the five spectra are:<br> 
UV:8.22×1014 Hz (365 nm, Mark 1)<br>
Dark purple:7.41×1014 Hz (405 nm, Mark 2) <br>
Purple:6.88×1014 Hz (435.8 nm, Mark 3) <br>
Green:5.49×1014 Hz (546 nm, Mark 4) <br>
Yellow:5.20×1014 Hz (577 nm, Mark 5)<br>
