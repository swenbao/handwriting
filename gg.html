        V. Procedure Magnetic frame Figure 4: Equipment setup. Measure the size of magnetic field under a specific distance: 1. Connect the gauss meter to the<br>
        probe, and the power, and perform the setting procedure accordingly as to loc its N/S poles (see instructions). 2. Arrange the device following <br>
         Fig. nd pay attention to the direction the probe is set. Magnetic rotating Chip shaft 4 Slightly rotate the shaft to adjust the distance d between<br>
          N pole and the semiconductor. Take a 0.5 thick acrylic board with d = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 cm. Measure each magnetic field distance and put your findings in<br>
           the chart. (Disengage the test board first after finishing and use the gauss meter to observe longitudinal changes in the field surroundings for Question 3).
